"Student Expression Prediction in E-Learning Platforms Using CNN" is a project that aims to 
improve the efficacy of online learning by predicting student expressions using face analysis. 
The technology provides two input methods: uploading a picture or utilizing a live video 
stream, allowing students to select the most comfortable approach. The system analyses facial 
emotions using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which have seven labels: anxious, 
annoyed, indifferent, excited, curious, distracted, and attentive. Students may connect into the 
system to post photographs or utilize the live cam, while faculty personnel can monitor all 
student expressions through a separate login. This feature enables educatorsto measure student 
involvement and alter their teaching tactics accordingly
**CNN Algorithm**
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network specially 
designed for processing structured grid data, such as images. CNNs have become the standard 
algorithm for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation tasks due to their 
ability to learn hierarchical representations directly automatically and adaptively from raw 
pixel data.
